aws-cost
```

To configure the credentials using aws-cli, have a look at the [aws-cli docs](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli#configuration) for more information.

If you need to assume a role, you can pass the `role-arn` option:

```bash
aws-cost -a arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/your-role-arn
```

> You can also get the output as a slack message

```bash
aws-cost --slack-token [token] --slack-channel [channel]
```

You will get the message on slack with the breakdown:

![Slack Usage](./.github/images/slack-usage.png)

You can set up a GitHub [workflow similar to this](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/c1a53cf3cc5c9b77634673754c8a5af4e83466d6/.github/workflows/aws-costs.yml#L1) which can send the daily cost breakdown to Slack.

## Note

Regarding the credentials, you need to have the following permissions in order to use the CLI:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:ListAccountAliases",
        "ce:GetCostAndUsage"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you need to use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), you will need to configure two IAM roles: the provider role and the consumer role.

1. **Provider Role**

   This role provides the necessary permissions for `aws-cost-cli`. It requires the above permissions policy and the following trust policy.

   **Trust Policy**

   Replace `arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YourConsumerRole` with the ARN of the consumer role.

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YourConsumerRole"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Consumer Role**

   This role is used by the user or service (such as GitHub Actions) that needs to assume the provider role to access cost information. It requires the following permissions policy.

   **Permissions Policy**

   Replace `arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YourProviderRole` with the ARN of the provider role.

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YourProviderRole"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

Please also note that this tool uses AWS Cost Explorer under the hood which [costs $0.01 per request](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/pricing/).
